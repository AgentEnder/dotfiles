# unslop-text

A Claude skill that strips the cues that make prose read as AI-generated and forces a
deliberate, human voice instead of the model's default register. It does not write the piece
for you or hand you a style. Every rule is weighted by the Reddit analysis in this repo
(89,239 posts pulled, 7,984 on-topic, across roughly 50 AI, writing, and SaaS subreddits,
2021 to 2026, plus a 600-post hand-audited sample).

The point that the naive version misses: replacing one default with another is not unslopping.
The 2024 tell was the smooth corporate voice (the em dash, `delve`, the `not just X, it's Y`
cadence). The 2026 over-correction is the clipped, forced-casual, fake-typo "anti-AI" voice,
and readers clock it just as fast. This skill flags the smooth defaults, warns against the
over-corrected ones, never prescribes a voice, and leans on a specification-first build mode
plus an `unslop-ignore` escape hatch for choices you made on purpose.

## What is here

- `SKILL.md` - the skill itself (build mode + audit mode).
- `references/tells.md` - the full ranked catalog: data evidence (cited share and keyword
  share), a real quote from the threads, the literal text the scanner keys on, and the fix for
  each tell, including a Part B for the structural tells a regex cannot see.
- `references/writing-with-intent.md` - the core mechanism: pin one of four registers (casual,
  conversational-professional, expository, formal), then a speaker inside it. This is the text
  analog of the UI skill's reference-site anchor, written as a process rather than a
  prescription (because any prescription becomes the next default).
- `scripts/unslop_text_scan.py` - a standalone scanner (Python standard library only).

## Vendored

Vendored 2026-09-08 from <https://github.com/JCarterJohnson/vibecoded-design-tells>, folder
`unslop-ai-text/skill`, by JCarterJohnson. The code is MIT; the Reddit quotes in
`references/tells.md` belong to whoever wrote them, harvested under Arctic Shift's terms.

It lives here rather than being installed so it can be edited alongside `author-prose`, which
runs it first and layers a personal voice on top of its findings. Local edits are expected and
this copy will drift from upstream. Check the source repo before assuming a rule came from the
data.

`initialize.js` links it into every configured skill host, so there is nothing to install.

## Run the scanner without installing anything

```bash
python3 scripts/unslop_text_scan.py ./draft.md          # full report + slop score
python3 scripts/unslop_text_scan.py ./draft.md --severity high   # only the strongest signals
python3 scripts/unslop_text_scan.py ./draft.md --json            # machine-readable, for CI
```

It scans .md .markdown .mdx .txt .rst .html and prints each finding with the file, the line,
the matched text, the data share it carries, and the fix, plus a slop score and a density
(slop weight per 1,000 words). The verdict is concentration-aware: a lone `comprehensive` or
one `delve` reads as "mostly clean," while the em dash and leftover assistant boilerplate are
absolute, flagged on a single instance anywhere. Be honest about what it is, though: for prose
this is a thin lexical filter. The highest-value tells (uniform rhythm, sycophancy, the rule of
three, over-formal register) are structural and invisible to it, so a clean scan means the
lexical layer is clean, not that the writing reads human. The real signal is the structural
catalog plus the density, not the pass/fail. The exit code is the number of high-severity
findings, so a CI step can fail on it:

```yaml
- run: python3 skill/scripts/unslop_text_scan.py ./content --severity high
```

It lints your running prose: a line you are quoting (it starts with `>` or sits inside "double
quotes") or a literal example in `backticks` is skipped, so the scanner does not flag a cliche
you are quoting in order to discuss it. The em dash is the one exception, flagged everywhere.

## What it deliberately ignores

The generic diction the keyword pass over-counts but real readers almost never cite: a lone
"however," "comprehensive," "robust," "when it comes to." They are mostly the writer's own
ordinary prose, so the scanner weights them low. The structural tells (uniform rhythm,
sycophancy, saying nothing at length) are also not flagged, because a regex cannot see them;
they are documented in `references/tells.md` for a human pass. Over-flagging trains writers to
ignore the tool, so the scanner stays narrow and ranks by what real readers name.
